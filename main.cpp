// TO FIX GENERAL
// 1. Change population to vector instead of array - need to keep a long long int for count of population, and find way of dealing with array of pointers (too long)
// 2. Remove all unecessary code - tidy up
// 3. When person dies, remove all related events, do something about events that should no longer happen
// 4. Make various event types (people-specific/annual events,...)
// 5. Use 'const' in model to stop model from changing variables thta it shouldn't change
// 9. Add class destructors
// 9. Make C++ run with Matlab � THIS IS TAKING A WHILE AND I AM STILL BUSY WITH THIS.  I am going to look at SJ�s code for this
// 10. Private versus public
// 11. Think about making your own priortiy queue 
// 12. Think about how to organise this program
// 13. Think about a parameter document



// TO DO List for HIV:
// 1. Add HIV status using incidence
// 2. Add HIV natural history (CD4 count)
// 3. Change mortality once they have HIV and dependant on CD4 coutn
// 4. Add more aspects of HIV care cascade (diagnosis, start cART,�)
// 5. Update HIV knowledge based on HIV test
